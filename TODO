[+] XML literals: heredocs /xml/, no escaping there

translation from HTML/XML:
  configure/write parser so that it can (optionally?) operate on the assumption of well-formedness of the source
    in such case if it can't correctly parse a fragment, let it fall back to writing it out verbatim as raw HTML/XML:

    raw xml [<?app instr?>]

    or

    raw xml `''<?app instr?>''

    or

    `'xml'<?app inst?>'xml'
